# Project Name

**Author**: Melanie Downing and Dean Murphy
**Version**: 7.0.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This is a blog application that allows a user to search through articles by author and category. A user can also create their own posts on the new.html page. This app now uses node.js to communicate with the back end to post the index.html and new.html page.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
A user must download the file, and open the page through their terminal while in that file. The user will need to install express and body-parser. In their browser, go to localhost:3000.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
JQuery

Node.js (with packages Express, body-parser, and nodemon)
